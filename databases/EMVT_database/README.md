# EMVT Database  
**Extreme Metal Vocal Techniques: A Comprehensive Dataset of Studio-Recorded Examples**

## Overview  
The EMVT (Extreme Metal Vocal Techniques) Database is a large-scale dataset currently in development, containing over **1000 professionally recorded vocal fragments** representing a wide range of extreme vocal techniques and vocal effects.

Unlike the more structured stimulus sets (e.g., Triple Twelve, METALVOX), the EMVT database is designed as a **broad and extensible reference collection** for music information retrieval, machine learning, and perceptual studies on extreme vocals. 
The dataset includes both controlled recordings and diverse experimental material, providing a rich resource for classification, acoustic analysis, and perceptual modeling.
The database features recordings from **15 vocalists** (13 male, 2 female), each contributing unique vocalizations across various techniques and experimental conditions.
## Key Features

- **1000+ annotated vocal excerpts**
- **Multiple vocal techniques**, including:
  - Growling (low, mid, guttural)
  - Screaming (fry, false cord, banshee, goblin)
  - Clean vocals (used as control)
  - Vocal effects (pig squeal, zombie scream, banshee scream, snarl, goblin scream)
  - Hybrid techniques
- **Different experimental conditions**:
  - With and without melodic contour
  - With and without melodic context
  - Clean vocals with melody
  - Clean vocals with "flat" or monotonous melodic contour ("one-note" melody)
  - Clean / Growl / Scream Ã— 2 melodic conditions
  - Multiple takes per excerpts when available
- **Two-microphone signal capture**:
  - **Dynamic microphone** (Shure SM57dB)
  - **Condenser microphone** (AKG-414)
  - Both tracks available for each recording for signal comparison and analysis
- **Fully annotated metadata**, including:
  - Vocalist ID and background
  - Technique label(s)
  - Source excerpt reference (linked to Excerpts Database)
  - Recording condition and mic configuration
  - Timecode alignment with original material (if applicable)
  - Acoustic features (to be computed)
  - Audio file paths (WAV, optionally MP3)

## Applications

- Acoustic analysis of extreme vocal techniques  
- Machine learning model training (classification, clustering, timbre modeling)  
- Perception and intelligibility research  
- Cross-condition comparisons of vocal production strategies  
- Teaching and demonstration of vocal styles

## Status  
This database is currently in development. 
Full metadata and audio files will be released upon finalization. 
Preliminary access may be granted upon request.
