## METALVOX Stimuli Set: 6 Vocal Conditions, 6 Vocalists

This set includes recordings from 6 vocalists (5 male, 1 female) who each performed 12 identical and 12 unique vocal fragments across six distinct conditions:

- Clean vocals with melody  
- Clean vocals without melody (or "one-note melody" monotonous singing)
- Screaming with melodic contour  
- Screaming without melodic contour  
- Growling with melodic contour  
- Growling without melodic contour

Each vocalist contributed a total of 144 recordings.  
An additional vocalist recorded only 7 of the 12 identical fragments; since the task was incomplete, these recordings were not included here but are available in the more comprehensive EMVT dataset.

This stimulus set was specifically designed for a **perceptual experiment** conducted as part of a research project presented at the **18th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC)** in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, July 2025.

Metadata for this set is provided in the `metal_vox.tsv` file.  
This table includes information about the vocalist ID, vocal technique, condition, source excerpt, filename, and timecodes for each recorded fragment.

Run `analysis.py` script to get descriptive statistics on the stimuli set, along with visualized spectral centroid analysis.

All corresponding audio files are located in the `audio/` directory.
