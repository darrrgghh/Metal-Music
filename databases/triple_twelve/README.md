## Triple Twelve Stimuli Set: 3 Vocal Techniques × 2 Conditions

This set contains recordings from 12 vocalists (10 male, 2 female) who each performed 12 identical vocal fragments* and 12 unique fragments using three vocal techniques (Clean, Screaming, Growling), recorded in two conditions:

- With melodic context
- Without melodic context (isolated or with melodic contour for extreme vocals)

Each vocalist re-recorded real musical fragments in both conditions. 
Musical examples were randomly selected from the excerpts dataset included in this project. 
One additional vocalist recorded the same material, but the recordings were excluded due to excessive clipping. 
Two more vocalists contributed ~30 unique fragments each using the same protocol; however, since they did not record the standard set of 12 identical fragments, their recordings are not included in this set. 
Those excerpts are instead available in the more comprehensive EMVT dataset.
Metadata for this set is provided in the `triple_twelve_stimuli_set.tsv` file.  
This table includes information about the vocalist ID, vocal technique, condition, source excerpt, filename, and timecodes for each recorded fragment.

All corresponding audio files are located in the `audio/` directory.
